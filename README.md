# Node Js Learning

A small application I built that manipulates the Node JS process object.


## Files included

`welcome.js` - If you run this file with node it will take your first and last name as arguments to greet you

`questions.js` - If you run this file with node it will ask for some info and write you a neat message back.

`timers.js` - You can run this file to see the progress in percentages of my project running a timeout of three seconds.

`core.js` - In this file I am using object destructuring to use some neat Node Js built in functionalities.

`ask.js` - In this file I create a better interface for asking a question and accepting a response using asynchronous JS.
